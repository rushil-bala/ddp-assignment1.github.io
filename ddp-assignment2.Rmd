## Introduction
In this assignment, the `mtcars` dataset was analysed. The following figure contains the `mpg` vs. `wt` by `am` plot of the dataset.

## Car Mileage by Weight and Transmission

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(plotly)
mtcars$am <- as.factor(mtcars$am)
levels(mtcars$am) <- c("Auto.", "Man.")
plot_ly(mtcars, y = ~mpg, x = ~wt,
        type = "scatter", color = ~am,
        text = ~paste("Weight: ", wt, "MPG: ", mpg)
        ) %>%
  layout(yaxis = list(title = "MPG"), xaxis = list(title = "Weight"), title = "MPG vs. Weight")
```
